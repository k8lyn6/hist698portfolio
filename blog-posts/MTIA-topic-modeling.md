- biggest critique: Field has accepted MALLET and LDA as sound, but not everyone really knows enough about topic modeling to be able to critique anyone who publishes based on research if they've tweaked it. Also, people aren't exactly encouraging people to learn exactly how these algorithms work. Is this how it should work? Who's going to critique people who mess around with algorithms if no one knows enough about it?
- is there really a sound "method" to choosing the number of topics? Seems like it's just kind of messing with it until it gives you something interesting. How do you know what's right?
- how does topic modeling work for non-english words?

- makes point that topics that make sense aren't really meaningful - being able to see to see that "sea sailor boat" all go together isn't super helpful. What is helpful is discourse -- identifying poetry, for instance
  - but can you really critique a topic that is less obvious? Have to know the collection, but still. Is it reading too much into it? Does it make sense
- can topic modeling be used to distinguish shows that have the same music potentially?
- he suggests removing names, but we would actually WANT those kinds of connections

- "A topic model takes a collection of texts as input. It discovers a set of “topics” — recurring themes that are discussed in the collection — and the degree to which each document exhibits those topics."
  - so yes, topic modeling could possibly be used to pull together scripts with similar music/themes
  - but would topic modeling work with a less-than-perfectly-OCR'd script? Only "important words" cleaned up?

- LDA doesn't know anything about word order in any particular document
- also showing me that some interesting things can be done to look at topics over time. Relevant to MTIA because could see what topics they focused on over time. Especially interesting when thinking of MTIA's role as "cultural ambassador"
- "By forcing us to attend to concrete linguistic practice, topic modeling gives us a chance to bracket our received assumptions about the connections between concepts."
