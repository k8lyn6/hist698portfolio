This is my about page. I could write about myself, but I don't feel like it at the moment. Instead, I will grace this about page with more generated [Taylor Swift ipsum](http://www.taylorswiftipsum.com/) text.

I know you heard about me we never go. Out of style dress up like hipsters. Death march club red sin saint dear. John Law & Order SVU. Free fall no it's Becky chill king better than revenge I. Almost do classic thing drunk. And grumbling on about how I can't sing new. Notch in your belt situation take me home trouble some indie. Record that's much cooler than mine 10 months sober wilfire lies. White t-shirt some other girl last December rain record. Changer Write Me A Song situation echoed leaves. Falling castle they'll tell you forever. Crossword stay this little I. Knew you were trouble Diet. Coke lock me out Olivia Benson some indie record that's much. Cooler than mine the fans Achilles heel so shame on me.
