This is my index page. I'm still playing around with the content, so this is dummy text. Also, I am terrible at design and despite reading a whole book on typography, I have no eye for these sorts of things. And now I've let my cup of tea get cold trying to make the nav bar work.

Now, I will continue the text on this page with [Harry Potter Ipsum](http://www.christinachern.com/hpipsum/).

Toad-like smile Flourish and Blotts he knew I’d come back Quidditch World Cup. Fat Lady baubles banana fritters fairy lights Petrificus Totalus. So thirsty, deluminator firs’ years follow me 12 inches of parchment. Head Boy start-of-term banquet Cleansweep Seven roaring lion hat. Unicorn blood crossbow mars is bright tonight, feast Norwegian Ridgeback. Come seek us where our voices sound, we cannot sing above the ground, Ginny Weasley bright red. Fanged frisbees, phoenix tears good clean match.
